# leaflet-challenge

## Update: I figured out I had used the wrong Leaflet function when attempting to make my data markers, fixing this now allows my map to load. Hooray!


## This project looks into earthquake data from around the globe and maps it onto an interactive world map in a way that instantly conveys the depth, magnitude, and location of the quake, along with the ability to click on each data marker in order to view the exact values.
